# Tangl Demo Playground Application

![](screen.png)

This demo application illustrates the embedding of the Tangl viewer and its UI library. It is designed as a playground with different settings to make it easier for third-party developers to understand how a function or API is implemented.

The playground also contains two example extensions for the viewer.
